<FONT COLOR="#b32d00"><h3>A school plays a crucial role in shaping a child’s future.
Not only does this include the provision of education and ensuring learning, but moulding the character,
 morals, and value system of the child as well.
A school provides the foundation needed to view the world as a limitless space providing innumerable
 opportunities to shine.
We, at ARYAN PUBLIC SCHOOL, strive to provide education that explores, challenges, and grooms every 
aspect of the child’s personality.
While we are determined to provide seamless learning targeted towards excellent academic performance
 through the incorporation of the latest teaching approaches, we also ensure that we are actively 
 working on the physical, social, emotional, and spiritual training of our children. We believe that 
 all children can learn and commit to nurturing the potential in each child. We focus on contextual 
 learning based on a constructivist theory of teaching & learning to provide techniques such as 
 problem-solving, learning by doing & inquiry-based learning activities. Our teachers help 
 students to test their ideas, draw conclusions & inferences in a collaborative learning environment 
 which transforms the students to become active participants in the learning process.
Our teachers are professionally equipped to develop adapt and modify curriculum content, pedagogy & 
assessment which suit the needs and aspirations of our students. We work towards a holistic, 
experiential, integrated, student-centered educational system that helps to improve the creativity, 
critical thinking, and problem-solving skills of our young learners to equip them for the ever-changing 
employment dynamics and global ecosystems. We educate our children to change the world through peace, 
empathy, and fraternity and place great emphasis on inner values.
During the pandemic, we shifted towards soft technology, online webinars, and virtual classrooms. 
There was an unimaginable collaboration among all the stakeholders in the field of education including 
administration, teachers, students, and parents for the transfer of knowledge in innovative ways.We are focused on a well-rounded and effective educational practice needed 
for the capacity-building of our children. It will develop skills that will drive their employability, 
productivity, health, and well-being in the decades to come, and ensure the overall progress of India.
Our sincere gratitude to all the stakeholders of Aryan Public School i.e. the management, staff, parents, and students 
for keeping your trust and belief in the school. We will continue with the spirit of inculcating 
ethics & ethos in young minds with aplomb and dedication even during this tough time.
Wishing all our children a happy and successful journey of learning!</FONT>
